# Student/Teacher - Task

## Overview
This is a real-time polling application where teachers can create live polls and students can respond instantly. The frontend is developed using React with Vite as the build tool, and Socket.IO facilitates real-time communication between the server and connected clients.

## Features

- **For Teachers**:
  - Launch polls with multiple options and a countdown timer.
  - Monitor live voting results as they come in.
  - Access a history of previously created polls.
  - Remove students from the poll room when necessary.

- **For Students**:
  - Enter a poll session using a room code shared by the teacher.
  - Submit votes in real time as polls appear.
  - Automatically redirected to a "kicked out" page if removed by the teacher.
